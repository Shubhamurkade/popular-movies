Popular Movies

This is a completely functional popular movies app which was made by me for a project on 'Udactiy Android Nanodegree Program'

The app was reviewed by udacity experienced revieweres and was designated as 'meets the specifications'.

Features

1. The app displays a list of movies which can either be sorted by pupular, high-rated, or favourites.
2. The favourites list is an user preference of the movies. Movies can be added into the favourites list by the user.
3. The app also displays the ratings and reviews for the movies.

API-KEY
The app uses 'moviedb' API so it requires an API key. The key can be got from moviedb website - https://www.themoviedb.org
The API-KEY thus obtained then must be pasted in file \app\src\main\java\com\example\shubham\popularmovies\Utillities\NetworkUtils

final static String API_KEY = "INSERT-YOUR-KEY";
